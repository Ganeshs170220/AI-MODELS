It begins by examining AI publications, \\nincluding journal articles, conference papers, and repositories. Next it considers data \\non significant machine learning systems, including large language and multimodal \\nmodels. Finally, the chapter concludes by looking at AI conference attendance and \\nopen-source AI research. Although the United States and China continue to dominate \\nAI R&D, research efforts are becoming increasingly geographically dispersed.Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentChapter 1 Preview\\n 4\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023Chapter Highlights\\nThe United States and China  \\nhad the greatest number of  \\ncross-country collaborations in AI \\npublications from 2010 to 2021, \\nalthough the pace of collaboration \\nhas since slowed.  \\nThe number of AI research collaborations between \\nthe United States and China increased roughly 4 \\ntimes since 2010, and was 2.5 times greater than the \\ncollaboration totals of the next nearest country pair, \\nthe United Kingdom and China. However, the total \\nnumber of U.S.-China collaborations only increased \\nby 2.1% from 2020 to 2021, the smallest year-over-\\nyear growth rate since 2010.Industry races ahead  \\nof academia.  \\nUntil 2014, most significant machine \\nlearning models were released by \\nacademia. Since then, industry has taken \\nover. In 2022, there were 32 significant \\nindustry-produced machine learning \\nmodels compared to just three produced \\nby academia. Building state-of-the-art \\nAI systems increasingly requires large \\namounts of data, computer power, and \\nmoney—resources that industry actors \\ninherently possess in greater amounts \\ncompared to nonprofits and academia.\\nAI research is on the rise, across \\nthe board. The total number of AI publications \\nhas more than doubled since 2010. The specific AI \\ntopics that continue to dominate research include \\npattern recognition, machine learning,  \\nand computer vision.\\nChina continues to lead in total \\nAI journal, conference, and \\nrepository publications.  \\nThe United States is still ahead in terms of AI \\nconference and repository citations, but those leads \\nare slowly eroding. Still, the majority of the world’s \\nlarge language and multimodal models (54% in 2022) \\nare produced by American institutions.Large language models \\nare getting bigger and \\nmore expensive.  \\nGPT-2, released in 2019, considered \\nby many to be the first large language \\nmodel, had 1.5 billion parameters and \\ncost an estimated $50,000 USD to \\ntrain. PaLM, one of the flagship large \\nlanguage models launched in 2022, \\nhad 540 billion parameters and cost an \\nestimated $8 million USD—PaLM was \\naround 360 times larger than GPT-2 and \\ncost 160 times more. It’s not just PaLM: \\nAcross the board, large language and \\nmultimodal models are becoming larger \\nand pricier.Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentChapter 1 Preview 5\\n496.01\\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 20210100200300400500Number of AI Publications (in Thousands)Number of AI Publications in the World, 2010–21 \\nSource: Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index Report Artificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023\\nOverview\\nThe figures below capture the total number \\nof English-language and Chinese-language AI \\npublications globally from 2010 to 2021—by type, \\naffiliation, cross-country collaboration, and cross-\\nindustry collaboration. The section also breaks down 1.1 Publications\\npublication and citation data by region for AI journal \\narticles, conference papers, repositories, and patents.\\nTotal Number of AI Publications\\nFigure 1.1.1 shows the number of AI publications in \\nthe world. From 2010 to 2021, the total number of \\nAI publications more than doubled, growing from \\n200,000 in 2010 to almost 500,000 in 2021.\\n1 See the Appendix for more information on CSET’s methodology. For more on the challenge of defining AI and correctly capturing relevant bibliometric data, see the AI Index team’s \\ndiscussion in the paper “Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges.”This section draws on data from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University. CSET maintains a \\nmerged corpus of scholarly literature that includes Digital Science’s Dimensions, Clarivate’s Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, \\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure, arXiv, and Papers With Code. In that corpus, CSET applied a classifier to identify English-\\nlanguage publications related to the development or application of AI and ML since 2010. For this year’s report, CSET also used select \\nChinese AI keywords to identify Chinese-language AI papers; CSET did not deploy this method for previous iterations of the AI Index report.1\\nIn last year’s edition of the report, publication trends were reported up to the year 2021. However, given that there is a significant lag in the \\ncollection of publication metadata, and that in some cases it takes until the middle of any given year to fully capture the previous year’s \\npublications, in this year’s report, the AI Index team elected to examine publication trends only through 2021, which we, along with CSET, \\nare confident yields a more fully representative report.1.1 PublicationsChapter 1: Research and Development\\nFigure 1.1.1Chapter 1 Preview 6\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023\\nBy Type of Publication\\nFigure 1.1.2 shows the types of AI publications released \\nglobally over time.

There were 23 significant \\nAI language systems released in 2022, roughly six \\ntimes the number of the next most common system \\ntype, multimodal systems.\\n6 There were 38 total significant AI machine learning systems released in 2022, according to Epoch; however, one of the systems, BaGuaLu, did not have a domain classification \\nand is therefore omitted from Figure 1.2.1.Epoch AI is a collective of researchers investigating and forecasting the development of advanced AI. Epoch curates a database of \\nsignificant AI and machine learning systems that have been released since the 1950s. There are different criteria under which the \\nEpoch team decides to include particular AI systems in their database; for example, the system may have registered a state-of-the-art \\nimprovement, been deemed to have been historically significant, or been highly cited.\\nThis subsection uses the Epoch database to track trends in significant AI and machine learning systems. The latter half of the chapter \\nincludes research done by the AI Index team that reports trends in large language and multimodal models, which are models trained on \\nlarge amounts of data and adaptable to a variety of downstream applications.1.2 Trends in Significant Machine Learning Systems Chapter 1: Research and Development\\nFigure 1.2.16Chapter 1 Preview 31\\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 202205101520253035Number of Signicant Machine Learning Systems\\n0, Nonprot1, Industry-Academia Collaboration2, Research Collective3, Academia32, IndustryNumber of Significant Machine Learning Systems by Sector, 2002–22\\nSource: Epoch, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index ReportArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023\\nSector Analysis\\nWhich sector among industry, academia, or nonprofit \\nhas released the greatest number of significant \\nmachine learning systems?

Although AI companies rarely speak \\nopenly about training costs, it is widely speculated that \\nthese models cost millions of dollars to train and will \\nbecome increasingly expensive with scale.\\nThis subsection presents novel analysis in which the \\nAI Index research team generated estimates for the \\ntraining costs of various large language and multimodal \\nmodels (Figure 1.2.17). These estimates are based on the \\nhardware and training time disclosed by the models’ \\nauthors. In cases where training time was not disclosed, \\nwe calculated from hardware speed, training compute, \\nand hardware utilization efficiency. Given the possible \\nvariability of the estimates, we have qualified each estimate with the tag of mid, high, or low: mid where \\nthe estimate is thought to be a mid-level estimate, \\nhigh where it is thought to be an overestimate, and \\nlow where it is thought to be an underestimate. In \\ncertain cases, there was not enough data to estimate \\nthe training cost of particular large language and \\nmultimodal models, therefore these models were \\nomitted from our analysis.\\nThe AI Index estimates validate popular  claims that \\nlarge language and multimodal models are increasingly \\ncosting millions of dollars to train. For example, \\nChinchilla, a large language model launched by \\nDeepMind in May 2022, is estimated to have cost $2.1 \\nmillion, while BLOOM’s training is thought to have cost \\n$2.3 million.Chapter 1: Research and Development\\nFigure 1.2.170.051.971.47\\n0.111.80\\n0.230.020.090.43 0.270.01 0.1411.35\\n8.55\\n0.09 0.242.118.01\\n0.601.69\\n1.03\\n0.162.29GPT-2\\nT5-11B\\nMeena\\nTuring NLG\\nGPT-3 175B\\nDALL-E\\nWu Dao - Wen Yuan\\nGPT-Neo\\nGPT-J-6B\\nHyperClova\\nERNIE 3.0\\nCodex\\nMegatron-Turing NLG 530B\\nGopher\\nAlphaCode\\nGPT-NeoX-20B\\nChinchilla\\nPaLM (540B)\\nStable Diusion (LDM-KL-8-G)\\nOPT-175B\\nMinerva (540B)\\nGLM-130B\\nBLOOM\\n2019 2020 2021 2022024681012Mid High LowEstimated Training Cost of Select Large Language and Multimodal Models\\nSource: AI Index, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index Report\\nTraining Cost\\n(in Millions of U.S. Dollars)\\n12 See Appendix for the complete methodology behind the cost estimates.1.2 Trends in Significant Machine Learning Systems Chapter 1 Preview 44\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023\\nThere is also a clear relationship between the cost of large language and multimodal models and their size. \\nAs evidenced in Figures 1.2.18 and 1.2.19, the large language and multimodal models with a greater number of \\nparameters and that train using larger amounts of compute tend to be more expensive.Chapter 1: Research and Development\\nFigure 1.2.18 Figure 1.2.19BLOOMGLM-130BMinerva (540B)\\nOPT-175B\\nStable DiusionPaLM (540B)\\nChinchilla\\nGPT-NeoX-20BAlphaCodeGopherMegatron-Turing NLG 530B\\nCodexERNIE 3.0HyperClova\\nGPT-J-6B\\nGPT-NeoWu Dao - Wen YuanDALL-EGPT-3 175B\\nTuring NLG\\nMeenaT5-11B\\nGPT-2\\n10k 100k 1M 10M1.0e+92.0e+95.0e+91.0e+102.0e+105.0e+101.0e+112.0e+115.0e+11\\nTraining Cost (in U.S. Dollars - Log Scale)Number of Parameters (Log Scale)Estimated Training Cost of Select Large Language\\nand Multimodal Models and Number of Parameters\\nSource: AI Index, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index Report\\nBLOOM\\nGLM-130BMinerva (540B)\\nOPT-175B\\nChinchilla\\nGPT-NeoX-20B\\nAlphaCodeGopherPaLM (540B)\\nMegatron-Turing NLG 530B\\nERNIE 3.0Stable Diffusion\\nGPT-J-6B\\nGPT-Neo\\nWu Dao - Wen YuanDALL-E\\nTuring NLGMeena\\nT5-11B\\nGPT-2\\n10k 100k 1M 10M1.0e+181.0e+201.0e+221.0e+24\\nTraining Cost (in U.S. Dollars - Log Scale)Training Compute (FLOP – Log Scale)Estimated Training Cost of Select Large Language and \\nMultimodal Models and Training Compute (FLOP)\\nSource: AI Index, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index Report1.2 Trends in Significant Machine Learning Systems Chapter 1 Preview 45\\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 20220102030405060708090Number of Attendees (in Thousands)59.45Number of Attendees at Select AI Conferences, 2010–22 \\nSource: AI Index, 2022 | Chart: 2023 AI Index ReportArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023\\nConference Attendance\\nAfter a period of increasing attendance, the total \\nattendance at the conferences for which the AI \\nIndex collected data dipped in 2021 and again in \\n2022 (Figure 1.3.1).13 This decline may be attributed \\nto the fact that many conferences returned to hybrid \\nor in-person formats after being fully virtual in \\n2020 and 2021.

To identify AI publications, CSET used an \\nEnglish-language subset of this corpus: publications \\nsince 2010 that appear AI-relevant.4 CSET researchers \\ndeveloped a classifier for identifying AI-related \\npublications by leveraging the arXiv repository, where \\nauthors and editors tag papers by subject.

The AI Index used the reported numbers \\nwhen available, or used 40% when values were not provided.Large Language and \\nMultimodal Models Training \\nCost Analysis\\nCost estimates for the models were based directly \\non the hardware and training time if these were \\ndisclosed by the authors; otherwise, the AI Index \\ncalculated training time from the hardware speed, \\ntraining compute, and hardware utilization efficiency.11 \\nTraining time was then multiplied by the closest cost \\nrate for the hardware the AI Index could find for the \\norganization that trained the model. If price quotes \\nwere available before and after the model’s training, \\nthe AI Index interpolated the hardware’s cost rate \\nalong an exponential decay curve.\\nThe AI Index classified training cost estimates as \\nhigh, middle, or low. The AI Index called an estimate \\nhigh if it was an upper bound or if the true cost was \\nmore likely to be lower than higher: For example, \\nPaLM was trained on TPU v4 chips, and the AI Index \\nestimated the cost to train the model on these chips \\nfrom Google’s public cloud compute prices, but the 53\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewAI Conferences \\nThe AI Index reached out to the organizers of various \\nAI conferences in 2022 and asked them to provide \\ninformation on total attendance. Some conferences \\nposted their attendance totals online; when this was \\nthe case, the AI Index used those reported totals and \\ndid not reach out to the conference organizers.\\nGitHub\\nThe GitHub data was provided to the AI Index \\nthrough OECD.AI, an organization with whom \\nGitHub partners that provides data on open-\\nsource AI software. The AI Index reproduces the \\nmethodological note that is included by OECD.AI on \\nits website, for the GitHub Data.\\nBackground\\nSince its creation in 2007, GitHub has become \\nthe main provider of internet hosting for software \\ndevelopment and version control. Many technology \\norganizations and software developers use GitHub \\nas a primary place for collaboration. To enable \\ncollaboration, GitHub is structured into projects, or \\n“repositories,” which contain a project’s files and each file’s revision history. The analysis of GitHub \\ndata could shed light on relevant metrics about who \\nis developing AI software, where, and how fast, and \\nwho is using which development tools. These metrics \\ncould serve as proxies for broader trends in the field \\nof software development and innovation.\\nIdentifying AI Projects\\nArguably, a significant portion of AI software \\ndevelopment takes place on GitHub. OECD.AI  \\npartners with GitHub to identify public AI projects—\\nor “repositories”—following the methodology \\ndeveloped by Gonzalez et al.,2020. Using the 439 \\ntopic labels identified by Gonzalez et al.—as well as \\nthe topics “machine learning,” “deep learning,” and \\n“artificial intelligence”—GitHub provides OECD.\\nAI with a list of public projects containing AI code. \\nGitHub updates the list of public AI projects on a \\nquarterly basis, which allows OECD.AI to capture \\ntrends in AI software development over time.\\nObtaining AI Projects’ Metadata\\nOECD.AI uses GitHub’s list of public AI projects \\nto query GitHub’s public API and obtain more \\ninformation about these projects. Project metadata \\nmay include the individual or organization that \\ncreated the project; the programming language(s) \\n(e.g., Python) and development tool(s) (e.g., Jupyter \\nNotebooks) used in the project; as well as information \\nabout the contributions—or “commits”—made to it, \\nwhich include the commit’s author and a timestamp. \\nIn practical terms, a contribution or “commit” is an \\nindividual change to a file or set of files. Additionally, \\nGitHub automatically suggests topical tags to each \\nproject based on its content. These topical tags need \\nto be confirmed or modified by the project owner(s) \\nto appear in the metadata.Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix\\ninternal cost to Google is probably lower than what \\nthey charge others to rent their hardware. The AI \\nIndex called an estimate low if it was a lower bound \\nor if the true cost was likely higher: For example, \\nERNIE was trained on NVIDIA Tesla v100 chips and \\npublished in July 2021; the chips cost $0.55 per hour \\nin January 2023, so the AI Index could get a low \\nestimate of the cost using this rate, but the training \\nhardware was probably more expensive two years \\nearlier. Middle estimates are a best guess, or those \\nthat equally well might be lower or higher.54\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewMapping Contributions to AI Projects to a \\nCountry\\nContributions to public AI projects are mapped \\nto a country based on location information at the \\ncontributor level and at the project level.\\na) Location information at the contributor level:\\n •  GitHub’s “Location” field: Contributors can \\nprovide their location in their GitHub account. \\nGiven that GitHub’s location field accepts free \\ntext, the location provided by contributors is \\nnot standardized and could belong to different \\nlevels (e.g., suburban, urban, regional, or \\nnational). To allow cross-country comparisons, \\nMapbox is used to standardize all available \\nlocations to the country level.\\n •   Top level domain: Where the location field \\nis empty or the location is not recognized, a \\ncontributor’s location is assigned based on his \\nor her email domain (e.g., .fr, .us, etc.).\\nb) Location information at the project level:\\n •  Project information: Where no location \\ninformation is available at the contributor \\nlevel, information at the repository or project \\nlevel is exploited. In particular, contributions \\nfrom contributors with no location information \\nto projects created or owned by a known \\norganization are automatically assigned the \\norganization’s country (i.e., the country where \\nits headquarters are located). For example, \\ncontributions from a contributor with no \\nlocation information to an AI project owned by \\nMicrosoft will be assigned to the United States.\\nIf the above fails, a contributor’s location field is left \\nblank.As of October 2021, 71.2% of the contributions to \\npublic AI projects were mapped to a country using \\nthis methodology. However, a decreasing trend in \\nthe share of AI projects for which a location can be \\nidentified is observed in time, indicating a possible lag \\nin location reporting.\\nMeasuring Contributions to AI Projects\\nCollaboration on a given public AI project is measured \\nby the number of contributions—or “commits”—made \\nto it.\\nTo obtain a fractional count of contributions by \\ncountry, an AI project is divided equally by the total \\nnumber of contributions made to it. A country’s total \\ncontributions to AI projects is therefore given by the \\nsum of its contributions—in fractional counts—to each \\nAI project. In relative terms, the share of contributions \\nto public AI projects made by a given country is the \\nratio of that country’s contributions to each of the \\nAI projects in which it participates over the total \\ncontributions to AI projects from all countries.\\nIn future iterations, OECD.AI plans to include \\nadditional measures of contribution to AI software \\ndevelopment, such as issues raised, comments, and \\npull requests.\\nIdentifying Programming Languages and \\nDevelopment Tools Used in AI Projects\\nGitHub uses file extensions contained in a project to \\nautomatically tag it with one or more programming \\nlanguages and/or development tools. This implies that \\nmore than one programming language or development \\ntool could be used in a given AI project.Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix55\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewMeasuring the Quality of AI Projects\\nTwo quality measures are used to classify public AI \\nprojects:\\n •  Project impact: The impact of an AI project is \\ngiven by the number of managed copies (i.e., \\n“forks”) made of that project.\\n •  Project popularity: The impact of an AI project \\nis given by the number of followers (i.e., “stars”) \\nreceived by that project.\\nFiltering by project impact or popularity could help \\nidentify countries that contribute the most to high \\nquality projects.\\nMeasuring Collaboration\\nTwo countries are said to collaborate on a specific \\npublic AI software development project if there is \\nat least one contributor from each country with at \\nleast one contribution (i.e., “commit”) to the project. \\nDomestic collaboration occurs when two contributors \\nfrom the same country contribute to a project.Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix'"

Preview 3Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023OverviewThis chapter captures trends in AI R&D.<eos> It begins by examining AI publications, including journal articles, conference papers, and repositories.<eos> Next it considers data on significant machine learning systems, including large language and multimodal models.<eos> Finally, the chapter concludes by looking at AI conference attendance and open-source AI research.<eos> Although the United States and China continue to dominate AI R&D, research efforts are becoming increasingly geographically dispersed.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentChapter 1 Preview 4Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023Chapter HighlightsThe United States and China  had the greatest number of  cross-country collaborations in AI publications from 2010 to 2021, although the pace of collaboration has since slowed.<eos>  The number of AI research collaborations between the United States and China increased roughly 4 times since 2010, and was 2.<eos>5 times greater than the collaboration totals of the next nearest country pair, the United Kingdom and China.<eos> However, the total number of U.<eos>S.<eos>-China collaborations only increased by 2.<eos>1% from 2020 to 2021, the smallest year-over-year growth rate since 2010.<eos>Industry races ahead  of academia.<eos>  Until 2014, most significant machine learning models were released by academia.<eos> Since then, industry has taken over.<eos> In 2022, there were 32 significant industry-produced machine learning models compared to just three produced by academia.<eos> Building state-of-the-art AI systems increasingly requires large amounts of data, computer power, and money—resources that industry actors inherently possess in greater amounts compared to nonprofits and academia.<eos>AI research is on the rise, across the board.<eos> The total number of AI publications has more than doubled since 2010.<eos> The specific AI topics that continue to dominate research include pattern recognition, machine learning,  and computer vision.<eos>China continues to lead in total AI journal, conference, and repository publications.<eos>  The United States is still ahead in terms of AI conference and repository citations, but those leads are slowly eroding.<eos> Still, the majority of the world’s large language and multimodal models (54% in 2022) are produced by American institutions.<eos>Large language models are getting bigger and more expensive.<eos>  GPT-2, released in 2019, considered by many to be the first large language model, had 1.<eos>5 billion parameters and cost an estimated $50,000 USD to train.<eos> PaLM, one of the flagship large language models launched in 2022, had 540 billion parameters and cost an estimated $8 million USD—PaLM was around 360 times larger than GPT-2 and cost 160 times more.<eos> It’s not just PaLM: Across the board, large language and multimodal models are becoming larger and pricier.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and

English-language and Chinese-language AI publications globally from 2010 to 2021—by type, affiliation, cross-country collaboration, and cross-industry collaboration.<eos> The section also breaks down 1.<eos>1 Publicationspublication and citation data by region for AI journal articles, conference papers, repositories, and patents.<eos>Total Number of AI PublicationsFigure 1.<eos>1.<eos>1 shows the number of AI publications in the world.<eos> From 2010 to 2021, the total number of AI publications more than doubled, growing from 200,000 in 2010 to almost 500,000 in 2021.<eos>1 See the Appendix for more information on CSET’s methodology.<eos> For more on the challenge of defining AI and correctly capturing relevant bibliometric data, see the AI Index team’s discussion in the paper “Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges.<eos>”This section draws on data from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University.<eos> CSET maintains a merged corpus of scholarly literature that includes Digital Science’s Dimensions, Clarivate’s Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, arXiv, and Papers With Code.<eos> In that corpus, CSET applied a classifier to identify English-language publications related to the development or application of AI and ML since 2010.<eos> For this year’s report, CSET also used select Chinese AI keywords to identify Chinese-language AI papers; CSET did not deploy this method for previous iterations of the AI Index report.<eos>1In last year’s edition of the report, publication trends were reported up to the year 2021.<eos> However, given that there is a significant lag in the collection of publication metadata, and that in some cases it takes until the middle of any given year to fully capture the previous year’s publications, in this year’s report, the AI Index team elected to examine publication trends only through 2021, which we, along with CSET, are confident yields a more fully representative report.<eos>1.<eos>1 PublicationsChapter 1: Research and DevelopmentFigure 1.<eos>1.<eos>1Chapter 1 Preview 6Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023By Type of PublicationFigure 1.<eos>1.<eos>2 shows the types of AI publications released globally over time.<eos> In 2021, 60% of all published AI documents were journal articles, 17% were conference papers, and 13% were repository submissions.<eos> Books, book chapters, theses, and unknown document types made up the remaining 10% of publications.<eos> While journal and repository publications have grown 3 and 26.<eos>6 times, respectively, in the past 12 years, the number of conference papers has declined since 2019.<eos>1.<eos>1 PublicationsChapter 1: Research and Development2010 2011

collaborations between academics, researchers, industry experts, and others are a key component of modern STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) development that accelerate the dissemination of new ideas and the growth of research teams.<eos> Figures 1.<eos>1.<eos>6 and 1.<eos>1.<eos>7 depict the top cross-country AI collaborations from 2010 to 2021.<eos> CSET counted cross-country collaborations as distinct pairs of countries across authors for each publication (e.<eos>g.<eos>, four U.<eos>S.<eos> and four Chinese-affiliated authors on a single publication are counted as one U.<eos>S.<eos>-China collaboration; two publications between the same authors count as two collaborations).<eos>By far, the greatest number of collaborations in the past 12 years took place between the United States and China, increasing roughly four times since 2010.<eos> However the total number of U.<eos>S.<eos>-China collaborations only increased by 2.<eos>1% from 2020 to 2021, the smallest year-over-year growth rate since 2010.<eos>The next largest set of collaborations was between the United Kingdom and both China and the United States.<eos> In 2021, the number of collaborations between the United States and China was 2.<eos>5 times greater than between the United Kingdom and China.<eos>1.<eos>1 PublicationsChapter 1: Research and Development2010 2011 2012 2013

Machine Learning Systems System TypesAmong the significant AI machine learning systems released in 2022, the most common class of system was language (Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>1).<eos> There were 23 significant AI language systems released in 2022, roughly six times the number of the next most common system type, multimodal systems.<eos>6 There were 38 total significant AI machine learning systems released in 2022, according to Epoch; however, one of the systems, BaGuaLu, did not have a domain classification and is therefore omitted from Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>1.<eos>Epoch AI is a collective of researchers investigating and forecasting the development of advanced AI.<eos> Epoch curates a database of significant AI and machine learning systems that have been released since the 1950s.<eos> There are different criteria under which the Epoch team decides to include particular AI systems in their database; for example, the system may have registered a state-of-the-art improvement, been deemed to have been historically significant, or been highly cited.<eos>This subsection uses the Epoch database to track trends in significant AI and machine learning systems.<eos> The latter half of the chapter includes research done by the AI Index team that reports trends in large language and multimodal models, which are models trained on large amounts of data and adaptable to a variety of downstream applications.<eos>1.<eos>2 Trends in Significant Machine Learning Systems Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentFigure 1.<eos>2.<eos>16Chapter 1 Preview 312002 2004 2006 2008

nonprofit has released the greatest number of significant machine learning systems?<eos> Until 2014, most machine learning systems were released by academia.<eos> Since then, industry has taken over (Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>2).<eos> In 2022, there were 32 significant industry-produced machine learning systems compared to just three produced by academia.<eos> Producing state-of-the-art AI systems increasingly requires large amounts of data, computing power, and money; resources that industry actors possess in greater amounts compared to nonprofits and academia.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and

AI’s evolving geopolitical landscape, the AI Index research team identified the nationality of the authors who contributed to the development of each significant machine learning system in the Epoch dataset.<eos>7SystemsFigure 1.<eos>2.<eos>3 showcases the total number of significant machine learning systems attributed to researchers from particular countries.<eos>8 A researcher is considered to have belonged to the country in which their institution, for example a university or AI-research firm, was headquartered.<eos> In 2022, the United States produced the greatest number of significant machine learning systems with 16, followed by the United Kingdom (8) and China (3).<eos> Moreover, since 2002 the United States has outpaced the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as China, in terms of the total number of significant machine learning systems produced (Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>4).<eos> Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>5 displays the total number of significant machine learning systems produced by country since 2002 for the entire world.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and Development7 The methodology by which the AI Index identified authors’ nationality is outlined in greater detail in the Appendix.<eos>8 A machine learning system is considered to be affiliated with a particular country if at least one author involved in creating the model was affiliated with that country.<eos> Consequently, in cases where a system has authors from multiple countries, double counting may occur.<eos>111112238160 2 4 6 8 10 12 14

machine learning models during training.<eos> The value of parameters in machine learning models determines how a model might interpret input data and make predictions.<eos> Adjusting parameters is an essential step in ensuring that the performance of a machine learning system is optimized.<eos>Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>9 highlights the number of parameters of the machine learning systems included in the Epoch dataset by sector.<eos> Over time, there has been a steady increase in the number of parameters, an increase that has become particularly sharp since the early 2010s.<eos> The fact that AI systems are rapidly increasing their parameters is reflective of the increased complexity of the tasks they are being asked to perform, the greater availability of data, advancements in underlying hardware, and most importantly, the demonstrated performance of larger models.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and Development1950 1954 1958 1962 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010

2023Compute TrendsThe computational power, or “compute,” of AI systems refers to the amount of computational resources needed to train and run a machine learning system.<eos> Typically, the more complex a system is, and the larger the dataset on which it is trained, the greater the amount of compute required.<eos>The amount of compute used by significant AI machine learning systems has increased exponentially in the last half-decade (Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>11).<eos>9 The growing demand for compute in AI carries several important implications.<eos> For example, more compute-intensive models tend to have greater environmental impacts, and industrial players tend to have easier access to computational resources than others, such as universities.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and

language and multimodal models has to do with their hypothesized costs.<eos> Although AI companies rarely speak openly about training costs, it is widely speculated that these models cost millions of dollars to train and will become increasingly expensive with scale.<eos>This subsection presents novel analysis in which the AI Index research team generated estimates for the training costs of various large language and multimodal models (Figure 1.<eos>2.<eos>17).<eos> These estimates are based on the hardware and training time disclosed by the models’ authors.<eos> In cases where training time was not disclosed, we calculated from hardware speed, training compute, and hardware utilization efficiency.<eos> Given the possible variability of the estimates, we have qualified each estimate with the tag of mid, high, or low: mid where the estimate is thought to be a mid-level estimate, high where it is thought to be an overestimate, and low where it is thought to be an underestimate.<eos> In certain cases, there was not enough data to estimate the training cost of particular large language and multimodal models, therefore these models were omitted from our analysis.<eos>The AI Index estimates validate popular  claims that large language and multimodal models are increasingly costing millions of dollars to train.<eos> For example, Chinchilla, a large language model launched by DeepMind in May 2022, is estimated to have cost $2.<eos>1 million, while BLOOM’s training is thought to have cost $2.<eos>3 million.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and

Index ReportArtificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023Conference AttendanceAfter a period of increasing attendance, the total attendance at the conferences for which the AI Index collected data dipped in 2021 and again in 2022 (Figure 1.<eos>3.<eos>1).<eos>13 This decline may be attributed to the fact that many conferences returned to hybrid or in-person formats after being fully virtual in 2020 and 2021.<eos> For example, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) and the 1.<eos>3 AI ConferencesInternational Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) were both held strictly in-person.<eos>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) continued to be one of the most attended conferences, with around 15,530 attendees (Figure 1.<eos>3.<eos>2).<eos>14 The conference with the greatest one-year increase in attendance was the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), from 1,000 in 2021 to 8,008 in 2022.<eos>13 This data should be interpreted with caution given that many conferences in the last few years have had virtual or hybrid formats.<eos> Conference organizers report that measuring the exact attendance numbers at virtual conferences is difficult, as virtual conferences allow for higher attendance of researchers from around the world.<eos>14 In 2021, 9,560 of the attendees attended NeurIPS in-person and 5,970 remotely.<eos>AI conferences are key venues for researchers to share their work and connect with peers and collaborators.<eos> Conference attendance is an indication of broader industrial and academic interest in a scientific field.<eos> In the past 20 years, AI conferences have grown in size, number, and prestige.<eos> This section presents data on the trends in attendance at major AI conferences.<eos>1.<eos>3 AI ConferencesChapter 1: Research and DevelopmentFigure 1.<eos>3.<eos>1Chapter 1 Preview 462010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021

DunhamThe Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) is a policy research organization within Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service that produces data-driven research at the intersection of security and technology, providing nonpartisan analysis to the policy community.<eos>For more information about how CSET analyzes bibliometric and patent data, see the Country Activity Tracker (CAT) documentation on the Emerging Technology Observatory’s website.<eos>1 Using CAT, users can also interact with country bibliometric, patent, and investment data.<eos>2Publications from CSET Merged Corpus of Scholarly LiteratureSourceCSET’s merged corpus of scholarly literature combines distinct publications from Digital Science’s Dimensions, Clarivate’s Web of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, arXiv, and Papers With Code.<eos>3MethodologyTo create the merged corpus, CSET deduplicated across the listed sources using publication metadata, and then combined the metadata for linked publications.<eos> To identify AI publications, CSET used an English-language subset of this corpus: publications since 2010 that appear AI-relevant.<eos>4 CSET researchers developed a classifier for identifying AI-related publications by leveraging the arXiv repository, where authors and editors tag papers by subject.<eos> Additionally, CSET uses select Chinese AI keywords to identify Chinese-language AI papers.<eos>5To provide a publication’s field of study, CSET matches each publication in the analytic corpus with predictions from Microsoft Academic Graph’s field-of-study model, which yields hierarchical labels describing the published research field(s) of study and corresponding scores.<eos>6 CSET researchers identified the most common fields of study in our corpus of AI-relevant publications since 2010 and recorded publications in all other fields as “Other AI.<eos>” English-language AI-relevant publications were then tallied by their top-scoring field and publication year.<eos>CSET also provided year-by-year citations for AI-relevant work associated with each country.<eos> A publication is associated with a country if it has at AppendixChapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix1 https:/ /eto.<eos>tech/tool-docs/cat/2 https:/ /cat.<eos>eto.<eos>tech/3 All CNKI content is furnished by

affiliation(s) are located in that country.<eos> Citation counts aren’t available for all publications; those without counts weren’t included in the citation analysis.<eos> Over 70% of English-language AI papers published between 2010 and 2020 have citation data available.<eos>CSET counted cross-country collaborations as distinct pairs of countries across authors for each publication.<eos> Collaborations are only counted once: For example, if a publication has two authors from the United States and two authors from China, it is counted as a single United States-China collaboration.<eos>Additionally, publication counts by year and by publication type (e.<eos>g.<eos>, academic journal articles, conference papers) were provided where available.<eos> These publication types were disaggregated by affiliation country as described above.<eos>CSET also provided publication affiliation sector(s) where, as in the country attribution analysis, sectors were associated with publications through authors’ affiliations.<eos> Not all affiliations were characterized in terms of sectors; CSET researchers relied primarily on GRID from Digital Science for this purpose, and not all organizations can be found in or linked to GRID.<eos>7 Where the affiliation sector is available, papers were counted toward these sectors, by year.<eos> Cross-sector collaborations on academic publications were calculated using the same method as in the cross-country collaborations analysis.<eos> We use HAI’s standard regions mapping for geographic analysis, and the same principles for double-counting apply for regions as they do for countries.<eos>Epoch National  Affiliation AnalysisThe AI forecasting research group Epoch maintains a dataset of landmark AI and ML models, along with accompanying information about their creators and publications, such as the list of their (co)authors, number of citations, type of AI task accomplished, and amount of compute used in training.<eos>The nationalities of the authors of these papers have important implications for geopolitical AI forecasting.<eos> As various research institutions and technology companies start producing advanced ML models, the global distribution of future AI development may shift or concentrate in certain places, which in turn affects the geopolitical landscape because AI is expected to become a crucial component of economic and military power in the near future.<eos>To track the distribution of AI research contributions on landmark publications by country, the Epoch dataset is coded according to the following methodology: 1.<eos>  A snapshot of the dataset was taken on November 14, 2022.<eos> This includes papers about landmark models, selected using the inclusion criteria of importance, relevance, and uniqueness, as described in the Compute Trends dataset documentation.<eos>8 2.<eos>  The authors are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper.<eos> For international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated.<eos> The number of authors from each country represented are added up and recorded.<eos> 7 See https:/ /www.<eos>grid.<eos>ac/ for more information about the GRID dataset from Digital Science.<eos>8 https:/ /epochai.<eos>org/blog/compute-trends; see note on “milestone systems.<eos>”Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix52Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewIf an author has multiple affiliations in different countries, they are split between those countries proportionately.<eos>9 3.<eos>  Each paper in the dataset is normalized to equal value by dividing the counts on each paper from each country by the total number of authors on that paper.<eos>10 4.<eos>  All of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.<eos>g.<eos>, monthly or yearly) with the normalized national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark AI research was during each time period.<eos> 5.<eos>  The contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends.<eos>Large Language and Multimodal ModelsThe following models were identified by members of the AI Index Steering Committee as the large language and

both a Chinese university and a Canadian technology firm would be counted as 0.<eos>5 researchers from China and 0.<eos>5 from Canada.<eos>10 This choice is arbitrary.<eos> Other plausible alternatives include weighting papers by their number of citations, or assigning greater weight to papers with more authors.<eos>11 Hardware utilization rates: Every paper that reported the hardware utilization efficiency during training provided values between 30% and 50%.<eos> The AI Index used the reported numbers when available, or used 40% when values were not provided.<eos>Large Language and Multimodal Models Training Cost AnalysisCost estimates for the models were based directly on the hardware and training time if these were disclosed by the authors; otherwise, the AI Index calculated training time from the hardware speed, training compute, and hardware utilization efficiency.<eos>11 Training time was then multiplied by the closest cost rate for the hardware the AI Index could find for the organization that trained the model.<eos> If price quotes were available before and after the model’s training, the AI Index interpolated the hardware’s cost rate along an exponential decay curve.<eos>The AI Index classified training cost estimates as high, middle, or low.<eos> The AI Index called an estimate high if it was an upper bound or if the true cost was more likely to be lower than higher: For example, PaLM was trained on TPU v4 chips, and the AI Index estimated the cost to train the model on these chips from Google’s public cloud compute prices, but the 53Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewAI Conferences The AI Index reached out to the organizers of various AI conferences in 2022 and asked them to provide information on total attendance.<eos> Some conferences posted their attendance totals online; when this was the case, the AI Index used those reported totals and did not reach out to the conference organizers.<eos>GitHubThe GitHub data was provided to the AI Index through OECD.<eos>AI, an organization with whom GitHub partners that provides data on open-source AI software.<eos> The AI Index reproduces the methodological note that is included by OECD.<eos>AI on its website, for the GitHub Data.<eos>BackgroundSince its creation in 2007, GitHub has become the main provider of internet hosting for software development and version control.<eos> Many technology organizations and software developers use GitHub as a primary place for collaboration.<eos> To enable collaboration, GitHub is structured into projects, or “repositories,” which contain a project’s files and each file’s revision history.<eos> The analysis of GitHub data could shed light on relevant metrics about who is developing AI software, where, and how fast, and who is using which development tools.<eos> These metrics could serve as proxies for broader trends in the field of software development and innovation.<eos>Identifying AI ProjectsArguably, a significant portion of AI software development takes place on GitHub.<eos> OECD.<eos>AI  partners with GitHub to identify public AI projects—or “repositories”—following the methodology developed by Gonzalez et al.<eos>,2020.<eos> Using the 439 topic labels identified by Gonzalez et al.<eos>—as well as the topics “machine learning,” “deep learning,” and “artificial intelligence”—GitHub provides OECD.<eos>AI with a list of public projects containing AI code.<eos> GitHub updates the list of public AI projects on a quarterly basis, which allows OECD.<eos>AI to capture trends in AI software development over time.<eos>Obtaining AI Projects’ MetadataOECD.<eos>AI uses GitHub’s list of public AI projects to query GitHub’s public API and obtain more information about these projects.<eos> Project metadata may include the individual or organization that created the project; the programming language(s) (e.<eos>g.<eos>, Python) and development tool(s) (e.<eos>g.<eos>, Jupyter Notebooks) used in the project; as well as information about the contributions—or “commits”—made to it, which include the commit’s author and a timestamp.<eos> In practical terms, a contribution or “commit” is an individual change to a file or set of files.<eos> Additionally, GitHub automatically suggests topical tags to each project based on its content.<eos> These topical tags need to be confirmed or modified by the project owner(s) to appear in the metadata.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendixinternal cost to Google is probably lower than what they charge others to rent their hardware.<eos> The AI Index called an estimate low if it was a lower bound or if the true cost was likely higher: For example, ERNIE was trained on NVIDIA Tesla v100 chips and published in July 2021; the chips cost $0.<eos>55 per hour in January 2023, so the AI Index could get a low estimate of the cost using this rate, but the training hardware was probably more expensive two years earlier.<eos> Middle estimates are a best guess, or those that equally well might be lower or higher.<eos>54Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewMapping Contributions to AI Projects to a CountryContributions to public AI projects are mapped to a country based on location information at the contributor level and at the project level.<eos>a) Location information at the contributor level: •  GitHub’s “Location” field: Contributors can provide their location in their GitHub account.<eos> Given that GitHub’s location field accepts free text, the location provided by contributors is not standardized and could belong to different levels (e.<eos>g.<eos>, suburban, urban, regional, or national).<eos> To allow cross-country comparisons, Mapbox is used to standardize all available locations to the country level.<eos> •   Top level domain: Where the location field is empty or the location is not recognized, a contributor’s location is assigned based on his or her email domain (e.<eos>g.<eos>, .<eos>fr, .<eos>us, etc.<eos>).<eos>b) Location information at the project level: •  Project information: Where no location information is available at the contributor level, information at the repository or project level is exploited.<eos> In particular, contributions from contributors with no location information to projects created or owned by a known organization are automatically assigned the organization’s country (i.<eos>e.<eos>, the country where its headquarters are located).<eos> For example, contributions from a contributor with no location information to an AI project owned by Microsoft will be assigned to the United States.<eos>If the above fails, a contributor’s location field is left blank.<eos>As of October 2021, 71.<eos>2% of the contributions to public AI projects were mapped to a country using this methodology.<eos> However, a decreasing trend in the share of AI projects for which a location can be identified is observed in time, indicating a possible lag in location reporting.<eos>Measuring Contributions to AI ProjectsCollaboration on a given public AI project is measured by the number of contributions—or “commits”—made to it.<eos>To obtain a fractional count of contributions by country, an AI project is divided equally by the total number of contributions made to it.<eos> A country’s total contributions to AI projects is therefore given by the sum of its contributions—in fractional counts—to each AI project.<eos> In relative terms, the share of contributions to public AI projects made by a given country is the ratio of that country’s contributions to each of the AI projects in which it participates over the total contributions to AI projects from all countries.<eos>In future iterations, OECD.<eos>AI plans to include additional measures of contribution to AI software development, such as issues raised, comments, and pull requests.<eos>Identifying Programming Languages and Development Tools Used in AI ProjectsGitHub uses file extensions contained in a project to automatically tag it with one or more programming languages and/or development tools.<eos> This implies that more than one programming language or development tool could be used in a given AI project.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and DevelopmentAppendix55Artificial IntelligenceIndex Report 2023 Chapter 1 PreviewMeasuring the Quality of AI ProjectsTwo quality measures are used to classify public AI projects: •  Project impact: The impact of an AI project is given by the number of managed copies (i.<eos>e.<eos>, “forks”) made of that project.<eos> •  Project popularity: The impact of an AI project is given by the number of followers (i.<eos>e.<eos>, “stars”) received by that project.<eos>Filtering by project impact or popularity could help identify countries that contribute the most to high quality projects.<eos>Measuring CollaborationTwo countries are said to collaborate on a specific public AI software development project if there is at least one contributor from each country with at least one contribution (i.<eos>e.<eos>, “commit”) to the project.<eos> Domestic collaboration occurs when two contributors from the same country contribute to a project.<eos>Chapter 1: Research and
